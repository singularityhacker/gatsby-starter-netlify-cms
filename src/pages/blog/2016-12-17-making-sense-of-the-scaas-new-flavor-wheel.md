In March of 2017, we held our very first guest bartending event at Johnny’s Wife’s Place in Jeanette, PA. Through the 50/50 & money tree raffle, the tips for the bartending competition, and donations, we were able to raise $1,900 in 3 hours! With such a successful night, we planned to utilize those funds for our TNR (trap, neuter, release) clinic a couple weeks later.

Some of the feral cats spayed or neutered.

Through the dedicated work of our volunteers, we were able to humanely trap almost 50 feral cats the week leading up to our Sunday clinic. 35 of these cats were street cats from Jeanette alone. Breaking it down further, 30 male cats were neutered and 19 female cats were spayed. A few of these strays had ongoing problems such as, upper respiratory infections, abscesses, a ruptured eye ball, and a tail in need of amputation. Thanks to our allies at Frankie’s Friend’s Cat Rescue, they were able to safely perform all the surgeries and give the extra medical care to those who needed it.

There were a few pets sprinkled into our clinic, and Frankie’s Friends graciously used their Petco feral cat colony grant to only invoice those pets fixed on Sunday. The money raised by our guest bartending event was originally planned to pay for the clinic, but we are now able to utilize those donations to fix even more free-roaming cats in the future! There are no words for how much we thank you, Frankie’s Friends!

An amazing team dedicated to helping cats in Western, PA.

The number of kittens prevented by this singular clinic is countless and astonishing. One day of devotion from all of these amazing people has helped to shape the future of Jeanette’s feral cat problem. A standing ovation to Frankie’s Friends Cat Rescue, our committed volunteers, Hungry Hank’s Pizzeria for donating food, and the property owners who graciously allowed us to set the humane traps. Without you, we would not have been able to do it!
