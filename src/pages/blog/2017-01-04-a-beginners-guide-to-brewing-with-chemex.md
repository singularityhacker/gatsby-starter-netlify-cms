## Tuesday March 7th, at Johnny’s Wife’s Place in Jeannette, PA

Come on out for great food and drinks! Support your favorite bartender team (one hour shifts) as they compete to see who can bring in the most tip money for SOS Animal Rescue! All tips from this evening go directly to the animals. 50/50, lottery tree raffle and $1.00 Jell-O shots. If you can’t make it, you can donate in advance to your favorite bartender and that will count towards their total. Bring all your friends!
