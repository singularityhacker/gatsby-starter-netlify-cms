    SOS Animal Rescue is a small pet rescue group in Jeannette, PA dedicated to
    saving stray and unwanted animals by providing vet care and finding them
    loving homes.

  Started in March 2015 by animal lover Dana Milliron, this small rescue is
  growing due to overwhelming support from friends, family, and the community.

        Our mission is to help reduce the unwanted pet population by properly
        vaccinating, spaying/neutering, and caring for them until a forever home
        is found.

        We also want to educate the public on numerous domestic animal issues
        and help people become better pet owners.

        At this time, SOS is only caring for kittens and cats. SOS is operating
        as a foster home-based rescue, and does not currently own a building or
        shelter.

    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
